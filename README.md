# README
This repo contains my solution for the first project of the udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.
The code and implementation is based on my solution to the udacity Deep Q-Learning algorithm coding exercise which I adopted from the open AI Gym environment to the UnityAgents environment.
