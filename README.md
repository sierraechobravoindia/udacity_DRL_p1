# README
This repo contains my solution for the first project of the udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.
The code and implementation is based on my solution to the udacity Deep Q-Learning algorithm coding exercise which I adopted from the open AI Gym environment to the UnityAgents environment.

# Introduction and Short Description of the environment

The environment is a 2-dimensional rectangular bounded world with yellow and blue bananas scattered around. The goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible and try to avoid the blue bananas. The corresponding reward function gives a reward of +1 for every yellow banana collectet end a penalty of -1 for every blue banana touched. The task is episodic 


## State Space

The state space consists of 37 continuous 

## Action Space

The action space is discrete and contains 4 possible actions:

- **`0`** - forward
- **`1`** - backward
- **`2`** - left turn
- **`3`** - right turn




## Environment is solved 

The environment is considered to be solved, if the agent scores on average +13 on 100 consecutive episodes
